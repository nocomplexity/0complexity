## Who is Behind NoComplexity?

[NoComplexity.com](https://nocomplexity.com/) is dedicated to simplifying business IT challenges in a rapidly evolving world. I’m Maikel Mardjan, and I believe that many business IT solutions are overly complex.


With experience across a range of architecture roles—including IT Architect, Security Architect, Business Architect, and Enterprise Architect—I have worked with various organizations to design IT systems that prioritize simplicity. I hold a Master’s degree (MSc) in Business Studies from the University of Groningen and a Master’s degree (MSc) in Electrical Engineering from Delft University of Technology. Additionally, I am TOGAF 9 Certified and hold CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification.

Currently, I lead initiatives at NoComplexity.com, an innovative IT company focused on straightforward solutions. For more insights and updates, you can find me on X (formerly Twitter) at [@maikelmardjan](https://X.com/maikelmardjan).
