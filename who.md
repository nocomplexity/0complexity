# About 0Complexity

## Who is Behind NoComplexity?

[NoComplexity.com](https://nocomplexity.com/) is dedicated to simplifying business IT challenges in a rapidly evolving world. I’m Maikel Mardjan, and I believe that many business IT solutions are overly complex.


The philosophy of NoComplexity begins with the “zero.” This zero stands for “NO”—no friction, no unwanted dependencies, and no strings attached.

More broadly, “zero” embodies a culture of minimalism. At [NoComplexity.com](https://nocomplexity.com/), we believe in adding value by reducing complexity rather than layering on extra features.

With experience across a range of architecture roles—including IT Architect, Security Architect, Business Architect, and Enterprise Architect—I have worked with various organizations to design IT systems that prioritize simplicity. I hold a Master’s degree (MSc) in Business Studies from the University of Groningen and a Master’s degree (MSc) in Electrical Engineering from Delft University of Technology. Additionally, I am TOGAF 9 Certified and hold CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) certification.

Currently, I lead initiatives at NoComplexity.com, an innovative IT company focused on straightforward solutions. For more insights and updates, you can find me on X (formerly Twitter) at [@maikelmardjan](https://X.com/maikelmardjan).
