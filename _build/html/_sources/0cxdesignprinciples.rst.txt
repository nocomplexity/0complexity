No Complexity design principles
================================

This section gives an overview of principles that SHOULD be used when designing systems.
If you are short on time and do not like reading: You MUST use the principles below to avoid adding complexity.

Summary of the zero complexity architecture and design principles:

1. Put People first! 
2. Only use what you understand.
3. Define specific criteria that are tangible to measure complexity.
4. Create a model of your solution
5. Separation of concerns
6. Reduce all waste.
7. Problems should be fixed through simple solutions. 
8. Design for change.
9. Make sure you can manage IT!
10. Privacy by design. 
11. Never over engineer

In the next section, all principles are explained more in depth. It is RECOMMENDED to read the rationale for every principle stated.
