# Overview 


Complex business IT solutions often fail and have a short lifespan. Over time, many complex solutions are deemed disasters—not only in terms of financial costs but also in other critical aspects.

Software for complex business IT problems becomes convoluted when simple principles for avoiding complexity are not followed.


This section provides an overview of the core nocomplexity principles that SHOULD be applied when designing systems.
