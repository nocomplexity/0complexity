Welcome to The Zero (0) Complexity Business IT Design principles
=================================================================

Abstract
========
Business IT Complexity prevention is a real must for keeping your company agile and adaptive. Stop wasting time and money on complexity. Effective complexity prevention prevents hidden cost, improves quality and enforces an in-depth understanding of problems and customer needs. This 0CX (zero complexity) standard defines architecture and design principles to prevent complexity for new products. A high level of complexity often means serious risks and cost for systems. Especially for systems where humans, processes, software and new technology play a major role.
