# Why


Our ever-increasing complex world requires smart principles to prevent useless grow of business it complexity. Complexity problems are biased. This is because complexity has turned out to be very difficult to define. But despite a clear definition: Too much complexity is never good. So you SHOULD strive to avoid complexity from the start when initiating business IT projects for building new systems.

In basic business IT complexity does not have to be negative. We love complex technology as long as we  have enough trust in the systems created. However we SHOULD be able to control all risks and be able to manage the created systems in an easy way. 

In general, to reduce costs and risks, complexity MUST be avoided.
Complex systems SHOULD be as simple as possible. Making changes on systems SHOULD not be a risk full and complex gamble. For simple systems maintenance cost are lower and quality is better predictable. 

Most of the time you are not aware of the root cause that causes complexity in systems. When you are confronted with complexity you experience strong negative effects. IT complexity can have very serious effects. Besides high cost for maintenance and change, complexity can lead to severe risks that can impact security, privacy and safety for humans. 

Nowadays any serious business is impossible without IT (Information Technology). So you SHOULD define general business IT design principles to prevent complexity in the systems you design. Since autonomous IT systems driven by machine learning software (like autonomous cars) SHOULD NOT become unneeded complex and high risk by default. We need solid architecture and design principles to mitigate risks when designing new systems. 

This  zero (0) complexity (0CX) business design principles RFC (Request for Comments) memo is meant to provide a reusable collection of principles to avoid and prevent complexity in new created large scale IT systems.  

The philosophy of the zero (0) Complexity design principles begins with the “zero.” This zero stands for “NO”—no friction, no unwanted dependencies, and no strings attached. More broadly, “zero” embodies a culture of minimalism. At [NoComplexity.com](https://nocomplexity.com/), we believe in adding value by reducing complexity rather than layering on extra features.
